Rebekah took out student loans, enrolled in community college, and retrained for a new career. They sacrificed for each other. And slowly, it paid off. They bought their first home. They had a second son, Henry. Rebekah got a better job, and then a raise. Ben is back in construction — and home for dinner every night.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:17" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:18">“It is amazing,” Rebekah wrote, “what you can bounce back from when you have to…we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.”</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:18" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:18">We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:18" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:18">America, Rebekah and Ben’s story is our story. They represent the millions who have worked hard, and scrimped, and sacrificed, and retooled. You are the reason I ran for this office. You’re the people I was thinking of six years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation. And it’s been your effort and resilience that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:18" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:19">We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing, and draw new jobs to our shores.

And today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is number one in wind power. Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008. And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save $750 at the pump.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:19" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:20">We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world. And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record. Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high. And more Americans finish college than ever before.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:20" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:20">We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition. Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices. And in the past year alone, about ten million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:20" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:21">At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits. Instead, we’ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in fifty years.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:21" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:22">So the verdict is clear. Middle-class economics works. Expanding opportunity works. And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don’t get in the way. We can’t slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns. We can’t put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or refighting past battles on immigration when we’ve got a system to fix. And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, it will earn my veto.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:22" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:23">Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives. Wages are finally starting to rise again. We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees’ pay than at any time since 2007. But here’s the thing — those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesn’t halt the progress we’re making. We need to do more than just do no harm. Tonight, together, let’s do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:23" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:24">Because families like Rebekah’s still need our help. She and Ben are working as hard as ever, but have to forego vacations and a new car so they can pay off student loans and save for retirement. Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage, and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota. Like millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isn’t asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:24" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:24">In fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances, and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot. We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity. We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the internet — tools they needed to go as far as their effort will take them.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:25" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:25">That’s what middle-class economics is — the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. We don’t just want everyone to share in America’s success — we want everyone to contribute to our success.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:25" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:25">So what does middle-class economics require in our time?</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:25" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:26">First — middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change. That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement — and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:26" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:27">Here’s one example. During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority — so this country provided universal childcare. In today’s economy, <span class=video-quote>when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever</span>. It’s not a nice-to-have — it’s a must-have. It’s time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or a women’s issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us. And that’s why my plan will make quality childcare more available, and more affordable, for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America — by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year.</div></section><div class=snappytv-embed style=position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;padding-bottom:37px><iframe src=http://www.snappytv.com/snap/childcare-more-than-ever-about-c-span-first-show-on-c-span_bq width=100% height=100% frameborder=0 scrolling=no style=position:absolute;top:0 webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:27" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:28">Here’s another example. Today, we’re the only advanced country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave. Forty-three million. Think about that. And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. So I’ll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let’s put it to a vote right here in Washington. Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave. It’s the right thing to do.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:28" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:29">Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages. That’s why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. Really. It’s 2015. It’s time. We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they’ve earned. And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it. If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:29" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:30">These ideas won’t make everybody rich, or relieve every hardship. That’s not the job of government. To give working families a fair shot, we’ll still need more employers to see beyond next quarter’s earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company’s long-term interest. We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice. But things like child care and sick leave and equal pay; things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage — these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families. That is a fact. And that’s what all of us — Republicans and Democrats alike — were sent here to do.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:30" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:31">Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:31" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:31">America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of GIs to college, and trained the best workforce in the world. But in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to do more.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:31" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:31">By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education. Two in three. And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need. It’s not fair to them, and it’s not smart for our future.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:31" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:31">That’s why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college — to zero.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:32" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:33">Forty percent of our college students choose community college. Some are young and starting out. Some are older and looking for a better job. Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market. Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy, without a load of debt. Understand, you’ve got to earn it — you’ve got to keep your grades up and graduate on time. Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible. I want to spread that idea all across America, so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today. And I want to work with this Congress, to make sure Americans already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments, so that student debt doesn’t derail anyone’s dreams.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:33" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:34">Thanks to Vice President Biden’s great work to update our job training system, we’re connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding, and nursing, and robotics. Tonight, I’m also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS, and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships — opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don’t have a higher education.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:34" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:35">And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend. Already, we’ve made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care. We’re slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and we’re making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs. Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden, has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get new jobs. <span class=video-quote>So to every CEO in America, let me repeat: If you want somebody who’s going to get the job done, hire a veteran.</span></div></section><div class=snappytv-embed style=position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;padding-bottom:37px><iframe src=http://www.snappytv.com/snap/hire-veterans-about-c-span-first-show-on-c-span_cr width=100% height=100% frameborder=0 scrolling=no style=position:absolute;top:0 webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:35" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:35">Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:35" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:36">Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined. Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs. Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming. But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didn’t even exist ten or twenty years ago — jobs at companies like Google, and eBay, and Tesla.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:36" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:36">So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future. But we do know we want them here in America.

Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this. So let’s set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline. Let’s pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than thirty times as many jobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:37" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:38">21st century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas. Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world’s fastest-growing region. That would put our workers and businesses at a disadvantage. Why would we let that happen? We should write those rules. We should level the playing field. That’s why I’m asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren’t just free, but fair.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:38" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:38">Look, I’m the first one to admit that past trade deals haven’t always lived up to the hype, and that’s why we’ve gone after countries that break the rules at our expense. But ninety-five percent of the world’s customers live outside our borders, and we can’t close ourselves off from those opportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said they’re actively looking at bringing jobs back from China.

Members of both parties have told me so. Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments. As Americans, we don’t mind paying our fair share of taxes, as long as everybody else does, too. But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight. They’ve riddled it with giveaways the superrich don’t need, denying a break to middle class families who do.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:41" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:43">This year, we have an opportunity to change that. Let’s close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in America. Let’s use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home. Let’s simplify the system and let a small business owner file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford. And let’s close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth. We can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college. We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:43" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:43">Helping hardworking families make ends meet.

Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, we’re partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America. In Iraq and Syria, American leadership — including our military power — is stopping ISIL’s advance. Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. We’re also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort, and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism. This effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed. And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 02:47" data-dateto="2015-01-21 02:48">Second, we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy.

Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, some suggested that Mr. Putin’s aggression was a masterful display of strategy and strength.

Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran; secures America and our allies — including Israel; while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict. There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. But new sanctions passed by this Congress, at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails — alienating America from its allies; and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again. It doesn’t make sense. That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress.

The best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we do not act forcefully, we’ll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe.

As a mother, a soldier, and a newly elected senator from the great State of Iowa, I am proud to speak with you tonight.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:26" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:26">A few moments ago, we heard the President lay out his vision for the year to come. Even if we may not always agree, it’s important to hear different points of view in this great country. We appreciate the President sharing his.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:26" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:27">Tonight though, <span class=video-quote>rather than respond to a speech, I’d like to talk about your priorities. I’d like to have a conversation about the new Republican Congress you just elected, and how we plan to make Washington focus on your concerns again.</span></div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:27" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:27"><span class=video-quote>We heard the message you sent in November — loud and clear.

For many of us, the sting of the economy and the frustration with Washington’s dysfunction weren’t things we had to read about. We felt them every day.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:27" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:27">We felt them in Red Oak — the little town in southwestern Iowa where I grew up, and am still proud to call home today.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:27" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:27">As a young girl, I plowed the fields of our family farm. I worked construction with my dad. To save for college, I worked the morning biscuit line at Hardees.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:27" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:28">We were raised to live simply, not to waste. It was a lesson my mother taught me every rainy morning.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:28" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:28">You see, growing up, I had only one good pair of shoes. So on rainy school days, my mom would slip plastic bread bags over them to keep them dry.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:28" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:28">But I was never embarrassed. Because the school bus would be filled with rows and rows of young Iowans with bread bags slipped over their feet.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:28" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:28">Our parents may not have had much, but they worked hard for what they did have.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:28" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:28">These days though, many families feel like they’re working harder and harder, with less and less to show for it.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:28" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:28">Not just in Red Oak, but across the country.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:28" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:29">We see our neighbors agonize over stagnant wages and lost jobs. We see the hurt caused by canceled healthcare plans and higher monthly insurance bills. We see too many moms and dads put their own dreams on hold while growing more fearful about the kind of future they’ll be able to leave to their children.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:29" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:29">Americans have been hurting, but when we demanded solutions, too often Washington responded with the same stale mindset that led to failed policies like Obamacare. It’s a mindset that gave us political talking points, not serious solutions.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:29" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:29">That’s why the new Republican majority you elected started by reforming Congress to make it function again. And now, we’re working hard to pass the kind of serious job-creation ideas you deserve.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:29" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:30">One you’ve probably heard about is the Keystone jobs bill. President Obama has been delaying this bipartisan infrastructure project for years, even though many members of his party, unions, and a strong majority of Americans support it. The President’s own State Department has said Keystone’s construction could support thousands of jobs and pump billions into our economy, and do it with minimal environmental impact.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:30" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:30">We worked with Democrats to pass this bill through the House. We’re doing the same now in the Senate.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:30" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:30">President Obama will soon have a decision to make: will he sign the bill, or block good American jobs?</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:30" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:30">There’s a lot we can achieve if we work together.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:30" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:30">Let’s tear down trade barriers in places like Europe and the Pacific. Let’s sell more of what we make and grow in America over there so we can boost manufacturing, wages, and jobs right here, at home.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:31" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:31">Let’s simplify America’s outdated and loophole-ridden tax code. Republicans think tax filing should be easier for you, not just the well-connected. So let’s iron out loopholes to lower rates — and create jobs, not pay for more government spending.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:31" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:31">The President has already expressed some support for these kinds of ideas. We’re calling on him now to cooperate to pass them.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:31" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:31">You’ll see a lot of serious work in this new Congress.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:31" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:32">Some of it will occur where I stand tonight, in the Armed Services Committee room. This is where I’ll join committee colleagues — Republicans and Democrats — to discuss ways to support our exceptional military and its mission. This is where we’ll debate strategies to confront terrorism and the threats posed by Al Qaeda, ISIL, and those radicalized by them.</div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:32" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:32"><span class=video-quote>We know threats like these can’t just be wished away. We've been reminded of terrorism’s reach both at home and abroad; most recently in France and Nigeria, but also in places like Canada and Australia. Our hearts go out to all the innocent victims of terrorism and their loved ones. We can only imagine the depth of their grief.</span></div></section><section class=annotation><div data-datefrom="2015-01-21 03:32" data-dateto="2015-01-21 03:32"><span class=video-quote>For two decades, I’ve proudly worn our nation’s uniform: today, as a Lt.
